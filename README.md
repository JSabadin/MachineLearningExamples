# Machine Learning Examples

## Overview

Welcome to the "Machine Learning Examples" repository. This repository is a collection of custom-built machine learning models demonstrating various approaches to regression and classification problems. Each model is uniquely designed using different neural network architectures and evolutionary strategies, all written from scratch.

Below, we present a selection of results achieved through the application of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, coupled with Evolutionary Strategies (ES) for optimization. These outcomes pertain to both regression and classification tasks.
